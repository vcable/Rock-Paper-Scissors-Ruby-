Simple rock paper scissors game made in Ruby.  I already did this in Javascript a while ago, and had an incredibly hard time doing it.  I'm hoping that now that I'm a (little) bit more experienced in programming, I'll be able to bang this out in a couple hours instead of a couple days :) 

update: it took me about an hour and a half to complete the program, which is a huge improvement!
